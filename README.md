# Conduit
Conduit is a simple 2D game engine written in Kotlin. It uses OpenGL as it's backend and currently only works on Desktop.
It's named after a mysterious artifact in Xenoblade Chronicles 2 that opens portals to new dimensions.

# Features:

- Custom Shaders

- Built-in easy to use ECS.

- Hardware-Accelerated

# Dependencies: 

- JOML for Matrix Math.

- LWJGL for OpenGL bindings.

# Project Info

The Project uses Gradle as it's build system, so basic knowledge of that is probably a must. 
It uses OpenGL 3.x so you'll need knowledge of Shaders, Matrices, Buffers, Textures, Perspectives
So on. There's plenty of bad code all around which I'm working to fix.

I don't have enough time to work on this. Especially with School, I'm only working on this on Weekends.
