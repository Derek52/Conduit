If you'd like to contribute to the project, this is probably stuff you should know. 

First of all, I can't guarantee any of your changes get into the project. Submit 
a pull request with your changes and ask me on my email stacksite8@gmail.com if 
you have any questions.

I'm really looking for anyone who has experience with OpenGL, (especially debugging)
and is well-versed in Kotlin. 


Thanks for reading.
